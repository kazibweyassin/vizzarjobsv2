**Day 10 - Wednesday: Pain Point Addressing**
```
"Why won't companies sponsor me?" 😔

I hear this question 50+ times per week. Here's the brutal truth:

❌ It's NOT because you lack skills
❌ It's NOT because sponsorship is too expensive
❌ It's NOT because they prefer local candidates

✅ It's because you're not showing CLEAR ROI on their investment

Here's what companies really think:
"If I invest $15K in sponsorship, will this person:
• Stay for 3+ years?
• Deliver exceptional value?
• Integrate well with our culture?
• Successfully navigate the visa process?"

🎯 THE SOLUTION:
Frame yourself as a long-term investment, not a short-term hire.

Example: "My international experience scaling products across Asian markets directly aligns with your expansion goals. I'm seeking a long-term partnership where my specialized skills in [specific area] justify the sponsorship investment through [specific value proposition]."
